1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float)a
Python primarily uses two numeric types:

int for whole numbers

float for numbers that may include decimal points.

Integers represent numbers without any fractional part, while floats can handle both whole and decimal values.

You can carry out standard arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and more with these types.

Keep in mind that floating-point numbers can sometimes introduce small precision errors during calculations.

Python includes several built-in functions for working with numbers, such as:

abs() – returns the absolute value

round() – rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places

The math module – offers more advanced mathematical functions.
